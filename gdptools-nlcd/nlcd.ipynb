    "# NHGF Tools and applications demo: Interpolating NLCD data to Delaware HUC12s\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the 2019 Land Cover product from the National Land Cover Database is interpolated to the Delaware River Basin HUC12s using the Geo Data Processing Tools (gdptools) grid-to-polygon area-weighted statistics tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Geo Data Processing Tools (gdptools)\n",
    "\n",
    "gdptools is a python package for calculating area-weighted statistics of grid-to-polygon. grid-to-line, and polygon-to-polygon interpolations. gdptools utilizes metadata from the OPeNDAP catalog to aid generalizing gdptools processing capabilities. There are also methods for calculating area-weighted statistics for any gridded dataset that can be opened by xarray, however some of the metadata encapsulated in the json entries will have to be added by the user. Examples can be found in Non-Catalog Examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Open Source Python Tools\n",

    "- [geopandas](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/index.html): Package to work with geospatial data.\n",
    "- [HyRiver](https://docs.hyriver.io/): Hydroclimate Data Retriever, suite of libraries for retrieving geospatial data from various web services. pynhd library used to retrieve NHDplus water basin polygons and data from the Hydro Network-Linked Data Index (NLDI).\n",
    "- [Holoviz](https://holoviz.org/): Python data visualization suite. Hvplot used to plot geospatial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "- [2019 NLCD Land Cover](https://www.mrlc.gov/): 2019 conterminous U.S. land cover at a 30-meter spatial resolution with a 16-class legend based on a modified Anderson Level II classification system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Maintenance Schedule\n",
    "- The intent of this notebook is simply a demonstration of an application or workflow. As we progress in the build-out of NGHF project tools, this notebook may be updated or replaced. There is no other planned maintenance at this time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates usage of gdptools to interpolate NLCD 30m land cover data to HUC12s for the Delaware River Basin. There are three sections:\n",
    "1) Data exploration and pre-processing\n",
    "2) Calculating zonal statistics for gridded land cover on HUC12 watershed basins\n",
    "3) Visualization of results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "- Linux OS or Windows OS\n",
    "- Conda-based package manager such as miniconda or mamba\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create conda environment\n",
    "- Download [environment-examples.yml](https://code.usgs.gov/wma/nhgf/toolsteam/gdptools/-/blob/develop/environment-examples.yml)\n",
    "- To create the conda environment, follow the steps below.\n",

As a simple verification, we plotted the raw data and determined the fraction of each landcover type.
